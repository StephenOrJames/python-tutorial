# Python: From Beginner to Winner

*(Like the catchy name? Thought so....lesson #1, always have catchy names.)*

This repo will take you through the basics of Computer Science/Engineering, Algorithms, and programming with the Python
interpreted language. - *Don't worry about what interpreted means yet, we will get there eventually*

Python is a great language, you can use it to create web apps, games, even a search engine!

This is for University at Buffalo's Association for Computing Machinery ( *ACM* ) but anyone is free to learn from it!
 
Each section of the tutorial is broken up into directories, each of which is like a chapter in a book, containing all
the relevant information and programs/scripts to try examples and such. I will also list some pretty cool programs that
make life easier.
