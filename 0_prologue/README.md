# Prologue

Everything listed below are important tidbits to know/have in order to complete the tutorial. 


## Basic Command Line Knowledge

Please follow [this link][1] to view some basic Linux/MacOSx terminal commands. Windows is a little different, so you 
can google those yourself - but really, please use a Unix machine, you should get used to it professionally.

Other that those commands, another useful command here is `python <filename>.py` to run a python file which we will 
be doing later.


## Git

Granted, the fact that you already have this proves that you've done some form of Git tutorial or at least made it to 
the repository in a browser. If not, follow [this link][2] to a blog post I did awhile back on it to get the basics.
 
 
## Python
* We are going to be using Python 2.7 - *Note* you can use 3.5 but remember that you then have to wrap `print` arguments 
with parenthesis. If these doesn't make sense to you, then don't worry about it yet.
* If you are running a Mac or Linux machine, there is a 99% chance that Python is already installed on your computer, 
because the language is included in the factory default packages - So woohoo! no work for you. If you are unsure, you 
can run the code `which python` in a Command Line terminal, and if it prints out a location - usually `/usr/bin/python` 
then you are golden.
* If you are running on a Windows, Google the python download executable and install it. Shouldn't run much differently 
after that than on a Unix machine.
