# The Goal of Computer Science....
**IS PANCAKES!**

Well no, but you will soon see how pancakes can be a good substitute for the mystery world of Computer Science.

For all you definition nerds out there, the exact definition/goal of Computer Science is...

For all of you non-definition people out there, the goal of Computer Science is to create the best - in terms of 
size/memory allocation and time efficiency - algorithms. The difference between a Computer Engineer and a Computer 
Scientist is that the engineer may focus on the actual physical layers of computation, usually a computer or other 
electronic device, while the Scientist works to make that physical device run faster and more efficient. Both have 
many crossovers and similarities, but in Computer Science you will most likely find yourself dealing with algorithms.

Now what is an **algorithm**?

### Algorithms are a Scientist's Cookbook

When you were in grade-school, you were taught a set of rules...

1. No running in the halls
2. Use your inside voice
3. Don't cuss

All of those rules and guidelines slowly were etched into your youthful mind, and it made you the person you are today. 
An algorithm is very similar to those sets of rules, but instead of transforming children, they transform data. 
In grade-school and high school, you most likely learned about **functions** in Math...You know, they always had the 
picture of a Input/Output machine with one kid at one end of the machine holding a `5` and another at the other end 
holding some new number `8` and you were asked to figure out what the function was. *Spoiler* but in this case its 
`x + 3`. In Computer Science, the Input/Output machine can represent the algorithm, and the `x + 3` is called an 
expression - something that equates to a certain exact value, either a number, True/False, a word, or something of the 
sorts. Algorithms are like the machine because they take one or more expressions, and they perform calculations on data 
input into them and spurt out new data after all the expressions have been evaluated. Although they might seem like 
magic, this is how all computers are designed to work. When you hit the power button on your Macbook, different 
algorithms are being run to start up your machine, like for example...

1. Run the Boot up code
2. Check to make sure the hardware is working
3. Load the operating system (Windows/MacOSx)
4. Show the login sceen.

Each algorithm is responsible for doing its assigned job, and all of those algorithms together are what allow you 
computer to work really well. Computer Scientists had to come up with all of those algorithms; they had to define all 
the rules/instructions of how to do those tasks. An algorithm has to be abstract enough to take in any type/amount of 
data input, but defined enough to accomplish a specific task. Some algorithms are more important, like picking out 
cancerous genomes from healthy ones, or they can be useful for entertainment, like drawing the yellow First Down line 
during a football game. A computer is told to find the ball position, add 10 to the yardage, and draw a line there 
under the players - its not that simple though. Some algorithms can be basic though and not include computers, 
**LIKE MAKING PANCAKES!**


### Let's Make Some Pancakes

I find that learning something is easiest when actually doing it, so let's come up with the algorithm to make some 
delicious pancakes. Now remember, an algorithm has to be both specific enough for us to make pancakes - not waffles or 
eggs - but it needs to be abstract enough that anyone can easily have this delicious breakfast. We will write this 
first in English, and then in **pseudo-code**, a mixture of English in code-like formatting.

#### The Ingredients & Supplies
Before an algorithm can work its magic, it needs to specify and make sure it has everything it needs to successfully 
happen. If everything isn't present, even down to the last detail, then it won't work correctly, and your pancakes 
will be disgusting or your computer broken. So what do we need for pancakes? Well I have this list...

The Supplies

1. 1 Nonstick Griddle
2. 1 Power Supply - for Griddle
3. 1 Spatula
4. 1 Bowl
5. 1 Mixing Spoon

The Ingredients

1. 1 cup Pancake Mix
2. 1 Egg
3. 2/3 cup Milk
4. 1 Teaspoon Vegetable Oil

*Notice how everything is explicitly listed, along with the quantity needed. As much detail as possible should be given 
in an algorithm, even like how we listed a power supply is needed.* 

Once you have everything you will need, you should write down the steps to complete the algorithm at its highest level.

1. Check ingredients and supplies
2. Mix Ingredients into Batter
3. Cook the Batter using the Supplies

Yay, so most people can read and understand that, but its not specific enough...Our inexperienced baker is like a 
computer and needs to be told step by step exactly what to do. The next step of writing an algorithm is to break down 
those high level steps into basic tasks.

1. Check ingredients and supplies
    * Make sure the Griddle is plugged into the power supply
        * If so, turn on then griddle
        * If not, then plug it in then turn on the griddle
        * Wait for the griddle to warm up
2. Mix Ingredients into Batter
    * Pour the Mix into the bowl
    * Add the milk, oil, and egg into the bowl
    * Mix the bowl until there is no dry mix left and no large clumps.
3. Cook the Batter using the Supplies
    * Pour a spoonful of the batter onto the hot griddle
    * Wait 45 - 60 seconds
    * Flip the batter to its otherside on the griddle
    * Wait 30 - 45 seconds
    * Remove the finished pancake

Now that is a well defined algorithm. It starts with all the necessary components and makes sure that everything is set 
up correctly, and then it begins step by step going through each basic instruction of completing its job, making sure 
that at the end you get a good finished project; a delicious pancake!

## What's Next?
In the next 2 sections, we will learn about the Python programming language, and we will start to plan and code our 
awesome pancake maker!
